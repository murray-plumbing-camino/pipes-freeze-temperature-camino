      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>When temperatures drop below freezing, the water inside pipes can freeze, leading to a range of plumbing issues, including pipe bursts. This is particularly relevant in Camino, California, where seasonal weather patterns create risks for both residential and municipal plumbing systems. Understanding when and why pipes freeze in this region is critical for preventing significant damage to plumbing systems, especially in homes with older infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The unique climate conditions in Camino, including colder winters and varied terrain, mean that local plumbing systems face challenges that differ from other regions. Proper insulation and maintenance are essential to ensure the safety and efficiency of plumbing systems in the area.</p>

      <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pipe Freeze</dt>
        <dd>Occurs when water inside pipes solidifies due to extremely cold temperatures, potentially causing pipe damage or bursts.</dd>
        <dt>Hydro Jetting</dt>
        <dd>A high-pressure water cleaning method used to clear blockages and debris from pipes, preventing issues such as clogging.</dd>
        <dt>Diagnostic Tools</dt>
        <dd>Equipment, such as sewer cameras, used to identify plumbing problems without invasive procedures.</dd>

      <h2>Process & Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>In Camino, plumbing systems are prone to freezing when temperatures consistently dip below 32°F. The process of diagnosing frozen pipes involves careful inspection of vulnerable areas such as uninsulated outdoor pipes and attics. Using advanced diagnostic tools like sewer cameras, plumbing technicians can locate blockages or cracks without causing unnecessary damage to the property. Once the frozen pipes are identified, they are carefully thawed using non-invasive methods to prevent further damage.</p>

      <h2>Technical Standards & Local Context</h2>
      <p>In Camino, all plumbing work must adhere to local standards for water conservation, pipe insulation, and emergency response. These standards are crucial in a region where freezing temperatures can cause extensive damage if not properly addressed. For official guidance related to water and sewer infrastructure in this region, refer to standards published by the <a href="https://www.saccounty.gov/Government/Pages/BuildingPermitsandInspection.aspx">Camino Building Permits and Inspection</a>.</p>
